# Guide to the Texas RRC Drilling Permit CSV Data

This guide explains the contents of the CSV files generated by the `parse_rrc.py` script. The script processes the fixed-width data file from the Texas Railroad Commission (RRC) and organizes it into a more user-friendly, relational format.

The primary identifier linking all these files is the `DA_STATUS_NUMBER`.

## Main Files

### 1. `permits.csv`

This is the main file and contains the core information for each drilling permit application. Each row represents a single, unique permit application block.

| **DA_CAN_RESTR_REMARK**      | The text of the restriction. This will be populated for both Canned and Free-Form types (though the field name originates from Canned). |
| **DA_FREE_RESTR_REMARK**     | The text of the restriction. This will be populated for both Canned and Free-Form types. Note: `_CAN_` and `_FREE_` fields are combined in the output for simplicity.|
| **DA_CAN_RESTR_FLAG**        | A flag indicating if the restriction applies to the entire permit ('P') or just a specific field ('F').                                  |

## How to Use This Data

The most common use case is to combine these files. For example, using a tool like Excel (with VLOOKUP), a Python script (with Pandas), or a database:

1.  Start with `permits.csv` as your main table.
2.  To find the fields associated with a permit, join `permit_fields.csv` to `permits.csv` where `permit_fields.PARENT_STATUS_NUMBER` matches `permits.DA_STATUS_NUMBER`.
3.  To see the restrictions for a permit, join `permit_restrictions.csv` on the same `DA_STATUS_NUMBER` key.

This relational structure prevents data duplication and provides a clean, organized view of the complex RRC permit data.
